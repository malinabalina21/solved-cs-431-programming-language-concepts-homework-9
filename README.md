Write a function merge_sort(lst: List[Int]): List[Int] that takesa list, and return a sorted list in increasing order.2. Write a function selection_sort(lst: List[Int]): List[Int] thattakes a list and return a sorted list in increasing order.3. Write a function insertion_sort(lst: List[Int]): List[Int] thattakes a list and return a sorted list in increasing order.You should place your methods inside an object and test them as follows.Object Main{// your sorting methods are placed heredef main(args: Array[String]) {val lst = List(5,4,11,2,3,1,0,9)println(merge_sort(lst))println(selection_sort(lst))println(insertion_sort(lst))}}2 SubmissionPlease write your solution in a text le by the name of hwk9.scala and submitit to the dropbox.1
